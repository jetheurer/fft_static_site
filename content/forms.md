On this page, you will find the forms you need to complete before we meet. Please download the forms if you have completed the initial free 15-minute phone consultation. To schedule a phone consultation, go to the [Contacts]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) page and send an email or call the office.

Please fill out these forms carefully and ask any questions you may have about them. Bring the completed forms to our intake meeting as we will not be able to proceed until these forms are completed.
