<summary>What can I expect when I start therapy?</summary>
<br>
<p>Since therapy requires considerable time, effort, and money. it is essential that we have a mutually shared understanding about the process of therapy. Typically, the first few sessions are dedicated to getting to know one another. During this time, we will work collaboratively to design some possible paths for you to achieve your goals for therapy.</p>
<p>By tailoring my approach to meet your unique needs, cultural background, and life circumstances, I endeavor to create a warm, supportive therapeutic environment where you feel heard and understood. The therapeutic relationship we create will enable you to engage in meaningful exploration of the issues that are impacting your well-being.</p>
<p>Sometimes, some clients may actually feel worse before feeling better. Feelings of distress and confusion can be a sign that you are starting to change as you are thinking and doing something different.</p>
<p>During all sessions, I encourage your feedback so we can continually modify your treatment plan. Therapy is a collaborative process and my role is to empower you to achieve your goals.</p>

<summary>How much do sessions cost?</summary>
<br>
<p>A free 15-minute phone consultation is conducted before scheduling.

The initial 90-minute intake session is $200. Subsequent sessions last for 60-minutes and are $150/hour unless you meet criteria for scaled payments. After one hour, the fee is prorated in 15-minute increments if necessary.</p>
<p>The $150/hour fee is also applicable to other services that directly relate to treatment (e.g. client telephone consultations, attending school conferences, writing reports, speaking or meeting with other professionals on your behalf). If my services are required for court related issues (e.g. depositions, courtroom testimony, travel time), the fee is $300/hour.</p>
<p>If you should you need to cancel an appointment, please send an email to info@FamilyandFinancialTherapy.com or leave a voicemail at 352-641-0239. If notification is received at least 24 hours before the appointment, no fee for services will be charged. However, you will be charged the full session fee for an appointment that you miss without giving advance notice.</p>

<summary>Are sessions covered by insurance?</summary>
<br>
<p>I am not an in-network provider for any insurance or managed care programs. I utilize a strengths-based and skill-building approach rather than focus on diagnosing particular disorders or mental health conditions. I prefer to treat emotional and behavioral problems creatively and employ interventions tailored to your needs instead of following the interventions that are mandated by a particular insurance company.</p>
<p>If requested and applicable, I will provide you with a diagnosis so you can submit a claim to your insurance company.</p>

<summary>When are sessions available?</summary>
<br>
<p>I book all sessions on a first come, first serve basis. If you have a preferred time slot, I suggest you schedule that appointment for many weeks. I offer sessions outside of typical work hours (weekday evenings until 8pm and weekend afternoons) but they tend to fill up quickly. Please contact me to find out what I have open on any given week.</p>
