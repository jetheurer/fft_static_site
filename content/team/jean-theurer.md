I specialize in helping individuals, couples, and families develop healthy, happy, and successful relationships. My approach is influenced by your specific needs, goals, and life circumstances.

I endeavor to create a supportive therapeutic environment where you feel heard and understood so you can engage in meaningful exploration of the issues that are impacting your well-being. Through therapy, I believe your relationships with yourself, your family and loved ones, and your money can improve.

My experience and training as a therapist deeply and positively impacts my work as a financial planner. There are many benefits in the pairing of therapy and financial planning that can help you experience more freedom, security, connection, gratitude, success, and joy.   

In addition to my focus on financial and relationship wellness, my research and clinical pursuits include life transitions, personal growth, family of origin issues, relational patterns and conflict resolution, career planning, premarital preparation, marriage success education, and parenting skills training.
