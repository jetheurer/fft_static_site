Your relationship with yourself is at the core of your happiness.

It is also the foundation for all your other relationships whether with your family and loved ones, or your money. Yet, it is the one relationship that most people ignore.

Individual therapy can help you become the person that you want to be by whittling away the habits that you want to eliminate, nurturing the parts of you that you want to grow, and developing new ways of handling life's joys and challenges.

## Individual therapy can help you...

- Be kind to and accepting of yourself
- Prioritize self-care such as sleep, nutrition, activity, rest, and recreation
- Increase awareness of your feelings, thoughts, and behaviors
- Boost self esteem and self confidence
- Identify and improve your interpersonal interactions
- Develop healthy communication techniques
- Cultivate optimism and positive thoughts
- Learn new ways to cope with stress and anxiety
- Embrace your strengths so you can uncover your true potential and lead the life that you desire
