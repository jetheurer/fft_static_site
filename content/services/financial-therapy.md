A newly emerging field that integrates mental health therapy with financial planning.

As a licensed therapist and certified financial planner, I am trained to help you understand the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and relational aspects of your emotional and financial health.

Money is woven deeply into almost every aspect of our lives. Sometimes financial knowledge is all that is needed to improve your financial circumstances. However, even the decisions of the savviest financial guru are affected by emotions.

A newly emerging field that integrates mental health therapy with financial planning
While we may want to believe that we make logical financial decisions by weighing only factual information, research studies have shown that our financial behavior is often far from rational. Since emotions play a significant role in our financial lives, financial therapy can help you create the relationship you desire with money.

- Explore the messages about money you receive from your family of origin
