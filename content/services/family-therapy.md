Invest in your relationships.

Whether you come alone or with the whole clan, family therapy can help you make the changes in your relationships that you desire. Small changes in how you interact with your family members can profoundly impact their interactions with you.

There are many reasons for a family to be unhappy and disconnected.  There are many transitions in the family life cycle that may create challenges (having children, adolescent and teen years, aging parents, illnesses, loss, divorce, financial struggles). Family therapy is designed to help you explore, understand, and learn to manage the multitude of influences on your family.

# Family therapy can help you...
- Learn how your family influences how you think, feel and act and how you influence them
- Heal past hurts and betrayals
- Recognize and understand multi-generational transmission of values, attitudes, and behaviors
- Improve communication
- Restore emotional connection
- Deepen admiration, affection, and appreciation
- Create shared interests and goals
- Understand and appreciate differences in parenting styles
